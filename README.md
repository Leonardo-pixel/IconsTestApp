Maui CollectionView StreamImageSource issue

When displaying a DataTemplate with images inside of a CollectionView, some weird behaviour occurs if you use a StreamImageSource as the source of the images.
When scrolling through the CollectionView you will notice icons shifting positions and icons appearing in places they shouldn't.
